## Development Prompts & Scenarios

### 1. Project Planning Prompts

#### Project Structure
Create a folder structure for a full-stack web application called StackIt, with a React frontend and Node.js backend using Express. Include folders for components, routes, models, and utilities.

#### Database Schema
Design a PostgreSQL schema for a Q&A forum with users, questions, answers, tags, and notifications. Include relationships and constraints.

### 2. Backend Development Prompts

#### User Authentication (JWT)
Write an Express.js route to register and log in users using JWT for authentication. Passwords should be hashed using bcrypt.

#### Post a Question
Create an Express route that allows authenticated users to post a question with a title, rich text description (HTML), and tags.

#### Vote on an Answer
Write an API endpoint in Express that allows a logged-in user to upvote or downvote an answer. Prevent users from voting multiple times.

#### Notifications
How do I implement a real-time notification system using Socket.IO in Node.js when someone answers your question or mentions @username in a comment?

### 3. Frontend Development Prompts

#### Rich Text Editor
Integrate a rich text editor like TipTap or Quill in a React app to allow users to format their questions and answers. The editor should support bold, italic, strikethrough, lists, emoji, links, image upload, and alignment.

#### Tag Selection Input
Create a multi-select dropdown in React using react-select to allow users to choose multiple tags when posting a question.

#### Notification Dropdown
Build a notification dropdown component in React that shows unread notifications with a bell icon, similar to Stack Overflow.

### 4. Admin Panel Prompts
Create an admin dashboard in React with pages to manage flagged content, ban users, and broadcast messages using a REST API.

### 5. Testing & Deployment Prompts

#### Testing API
Write unit tests for the question posting API using Jest and Supertest in an Express app.

#### Deployment
How can I deploy a React frontend on Vercel and an Express backend on Render, and connect them securely using environment variables?

### 6. Bonus Features (Optional)

#### Gamification / Badges
Add a badge system that rewards users based on their activity: first question, top answer, most upvotes, etc.

#### Search Functionality
Implement full-text search in PostgreSQL to search questions by title and tags using a /search?q= endpoint.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (maintained for UI)
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui component library

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:

   - Successful auth → User data stored/updated in database
   - Session created and stored in PostgreSQL
   - Frontend receives user data via protected API

2. **Question Flow**:
   - User creates question → Stored with rich text content
   - Questions displayed with pagination and filtering
   - Search functionality queries database with text matching
   - View count incremented on question access

3. **Answer Flow**:
   - Users submit answers to questions
   - Answers support rich text formatting
   - Question authors can accept answers
   - Voting system tracks answer quality

4. **Notification Flow**:
   - System events trigger notification creation
   - Real-time updates via polling (can be enhanced with WebSockets)
   - Users receive notifications for relevant interactions
